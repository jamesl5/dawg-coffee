The spec needs more explanation on specific settings. Since some of details (padding, margin, size) are not fully explained and the spec simply says "make yours similar to this", 
students become obsessed about making the contents look similar in afraid of losing points and waste a lot of time(rather than learning how to use certain elements and tools).
